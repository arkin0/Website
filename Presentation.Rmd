This tutorial provides an introduction to creating websites using R, R Markdown and GitHub pages. 

This tutorial was originally presented at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics R User Group meeting on January 23, 2018.

The current version was updated and presented at the R Ladies NYC Meetup on February 15, 2018.


## Types of websites

The main types of websites you may want to create include:

1. Personal websites
2. Package websites
3. Project websites
4. Blogs


## R Markdown website basics


The minimum requirements for an R Markdown website are:

- `index.Rmd`: contains the content for the website homepage
- `_site.yml`: contains metadata for the website

A basic example of a `_site.yml` file for a website with two pages:

```{r eval = FALSE}
name: "my-website"
navbar:
  title: "My Website"
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
```

And a basic `index.Rmd` to create the Home page:

```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "My Website"
---
    
Hello, Website! Welcome to the world.
```

## Personal websites

An example from the homepage of  [my personal website](http://www.emilyzabor.com/):

<img src="img/personal.png" style="border: #A9A9A9 1px solid; width:75%">


There are two main steps for creating a personal website that will be hosted on GitHub:

1. GitHub setup
2. Local setup

### GitHub setup

1. Create a GitHub repository ("repo") named YOUR_GH_NAME.github.io, where YOUR_GH_NAME is your GitHub username.
2. Initialize it with a README 
    - For the GitHub inexperienced: this can ease the process of cloning the repo by initializing the remote repo with a master branch
